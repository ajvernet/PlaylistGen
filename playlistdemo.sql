Julie is 46, she grew up in Annapolis and Germany. She has been working with the same marketing company for 20 years. Julie is on her 4th year in a relationship with a great guy who is a normal drinker. She loves to stay active and be outside.</span>   What are you going to do differently this time?   <span>Julie was sober for 129 days before relapsing at a wedding. Now, the next thing for her is to get to 130 days. Julie was “white-knuckling” it, doing it all on her own. This time around, the difference is that Julie is reaching out and connecting through Cafe RE, sober friends, and she is holding herself accountable.</span>   Julie speaks on how to tell your friends, “I don’t drink,”   Talk to me about your bottom?   <span>“I let down a friend. I had promised to help a friend at a certain time. I drank. And I passed out… Sleeping through my commitment.” Despite many other signs that somehow didn’t get Julie to quit for very long… this was the final trigger. “I’d have many incidents where I would stop for one to three days, but this last one was it.”</span>   What were your drinking habits like?   <span>“I was a wine drinker. When one (referring to either \'red\' or \'white\') would present a problem to me, I would switch. Sometimes it was ‘red’ and then it was ‘white.’ I don’t like beer or hard liquor. In High School I felt that my shyness was hurting me, so I started drinking to “loosen-up.” Come college, I’d be the one passed out on the couch. It never occurred to me that I had a problem. In my 30s, it got pretty scary. I started drinking alone. I just took the ball and ran with it.” </span>   Did you ever try to “cut-back” and put rules in place?   <span>Julie played games. The ‘red’ wine, ‘white’ wine game. She wouldn’t keep wine in the house, but would play games where she based her whole lifestyle around the wine shop hours. She used day/time constraints to “control” the drinking… Shockingly, it didn’t work. “I remember standing on my front porch thinking, drinking is my biggest problem ever.” Julie used to drink to calm her anxiety, but what she found was that drinking actually caused anxiety.</span>   Walk me through the start of your sobriety.   <span>“Whatever works for you, grab it and go with it!” Julie does not participate in AA, but sees it as a very valid way to support a sober journey. Julie uses the Cafe RE Facebook group to connect and create sober like-minded friends. Julie reads a lot of books, listens to podcasts, and connects with others.</span>   <span>What does your recovery portfolio look like today? </span>   <span>“In recovery, I have a whole lot more free time.” Julie is very connected to Cafe RE’s Facebook Group (unsearchable and private group).  </span>   Rapid Fire Round     What was your worst memory from drinking? <span> “I passed out in an Uber and the driver couldn’t wake me up when h',3096,'https://www.audiosear.ch/media/5d1b9005635ab76985aa16b7576dbf7c/0/public/audio_file/187536/RE81_mixdown_1.mp3',6077,'Recovery Elevator | Stop Drinking, Start Recovering. | Alcohol, Addiction & Life in Sobriety','https://www.audiosear.ch/media/a63f3ff3d62fb856c227ce1a890fbc06/0/thumb/image_file/62343/600x600bb.jpg'),(12,24744,'Willie Nelson',5,'The singer has written 2,500 songs and has won seven Grammys.

It’s not just “should I be staring at a screen for this many hours of the day?” or \"I am having \'House of Cards\' nightmares.\" It’s that there are so many choices, content-related and otherwise. Sometimes it’s hard to sort through them.  We want to help you watch online TV better: better shows to watch, better ways to watch, and, to offer up a little guidance on the thorny questions of what to pay for. Hopefully, this week\'s podcast lightens the conscience of your inner couch potato.  Our conversation with Ben Sinclair and Katja Blichfeld, the creators of \"High Maintenance,\" points the way. They\'ve chosen to put their show exclusively online in a bargain that bestows artistic freedom but leaves them kinda broke. We also talk to our friend, Arwa Gunja, otherwise known as \"The Streamstress.\"   One of the questions that came up: Is it OK to share log-in information with people outside of your household? If you\'re like 46 percent of HBO Go/Netflix/Hulu Plus/WatchESPN/Amazon Prime Instant Video watchers, you have too. The CEO of HBO Go may or may not care. There\'s a shaky, complicated, really, really big debate out there.  After we wrapped the taping of our show craving even more certainty, we posed the question to a whole bunch of people who think about the bright lines of acceptable behavior — a priest, an imam, a Supreme Court justice (she very politely declined), and more... Matt Kilmer, Music Coordinator and composer for ‘Louie’: \"...If you live with two roommates, it\'s fine to have one account between you all, and likewise with family living under one roof. However, if you are sharing a password with your old best friend from high school who lives on the opposite coast as you, then that\'s crossing the line IMO...$7.99/mo isn\'t breaking the bank for anyone who owns a device capable of streaming from any of these services.\" Marci Auld Glass, pastor of Southminster Presbyterian Church in Boise, Idaho: \"I personally share my Netflix and HBO account with my son who is at college. If any other family asked me, I would likely share with them too. I haven’t had friends ask me, but I would be less likely to do that, I think... I am not sure I have an objection to sharing digital media. I purchase my digital music and video, and am happy to do so. I understand why companies would put limits on how many “devices” can be used by one account. They need to make money.\"  Mitra Kaboli, senior producer of \'The Heart\': \"For the last few years, honestly more than I can remember, I\'ve been using an old lover of mine\'s Netflix account... Ethically, I have no problem with this. It\'s such a small sum of money and I feel like Netflix acknowledges that accounts are shared so I don\'t feel any moral qualms. The larger issue was if he got a new credit card, so I could no longer continue my \'Orange is the New Black\' binge... Sometimes I got paranoid that these were passive aggressive messages aimed at me. Although, I\'m certain they are not. He shared that account with seven or so people.\" Mustafa Umar, Director of Education and Outreach at the Islamic Institute of Orange County, California: \"Sharing a password to copyrighted material is a gray area because it violates the intellectual property and copyright laws which you agreed to in the terms of service when signing up for the service.

Will they remain a part of the European Union, or strike out on their own? “NewsHour” special correspondent Malcolm Brabant has been talking to people in the East of England. He brings us this report. MALCOLM BRABANT: With local polls suggesting that most East Anglians favor Brexit, the remain campaigners cranked up their polite offensive in the market town of Ipswich. MAN: What do you think about it? Are you going to vote yes? TIAH BENJAMIN, Student: Yes, I’m going to vote to remain, because I don’t really see the point in not voting to remain, because you literally lose like so much. WOMAN: Hi. Will you be voting next Thursday? Do you know which way you’re going to vote? WOMAN: Yes. Remain. WOMAN: Remain. Fantastic, excellent. WOMAN: Out. WOMAN: Out. WOMAN: Definitely out. OK. Do you want to talk about it? WOMAN: Shut that bloody channel tunnel up, mate. WOMAN: Really? WOMAN: Yes, absolutely, concrete it up. WOMAN: OK. WOMAN: Yes. WOMAN: I think (INAUDIBLE) for our country. MALCOLM BRABANT: But her suggestion that immigration made the country’s foundation stronger met a sharp response. WOMAN: My husband served 27 years in the military, and what have we got to show for it? Nothing. Fighting to keep them out, definitely out, absolutely, 100 percent, 100 percent out. My dad, his dad, my grandparents all fought to keep this country British. MALCOLM BRABANT: So, is Britain about to chime in with a painful divorce, after an often turbulent, fractious, and skeptical 43-year union with her neighbors across the North Sea, and declare independence day? At this gentle summer garden party in the village of Hoxne, in amongst the cream teas, one of the key referendum issues reared its head in an almost visceral manner. PETER LOCKETT, Retired Electrician: I think we should stop immigration and not allow any more people in the country. I think there’s far too many as well pinching our money for national health and all that sort of thing. MALCOLM BRABANT: Next to the sausage stand, the conversation switched to national sovereignty and the deep resentment many Britons feel about the amount of control exerted by unelected European commissioners and their unaccountable staff in Brussels. STUART JARROLD, Sports Reporter: Every year, every day, every hour, we are spending so much money with faceless individuals who — we can’t even govern ourselves. Why can’t we, as a nation, run our own country? ANTHONY BENTON, Import Export Businessman: In the long run, if the human race is going to exist to survive on this planet that we’re wrecking, then we need to come together and work together. MALCOLM BRABANT: Karon Saunders is a truly international woman with part Italian heritage who’s worked around the world. But she will vote to leave. She says excessive E.U. regulation is endangering her small organic free-range farm. She struggles to get her animals into abattoirs that favor industrial food producers, has given up breeding turkeys and has lost money because of E.U. rules governing slaughtering. KARON SAUNDERS, Organic Farmer: I don’t want people’s employment rights, I don’t want their human rights changed. I don’t want that to be lessened. And I don’t think it will. What I do want is to be able to look at legislation in a realistic manner. We may be able to put in the small slaughter houses, have that working for us, rather than working against us. Why do we need a vet to stand over people who for centuries have always killed the animals usually at the back of the butcher’s or at home? There are legislations and there are ways that we can work that our standards don’t drop. LINDA DUFFIN, Financial Journalist: I do think a lot of Brexiters have essentially got their fingers in their ears and they are going la, la, la, la, la, because if we leave Europe, on what terms do we then do business with Europe? MALCOLM BRABANT: Mrs. Portly has spoken. That’s the name financial journalist Linda Duffin uses when she blogs about food. LINDA DUFFIN: My concerns are the potential for a drop in trade and investor uncertainty. If you look at the figures, 42 percent of our exports are to the E.U., 48 percent of our foreign direct trade is from the E.U. Essentially, if we leave the E.U., we will have to toe the line, but we won’t have any say in where that line is drawn. NARRATOR: Every week, the United Kingdom sends 350 million pounds of taxpayers money to the E.U. That’s the cost of a fully staffed brand-new hospital. GORDON BROWN, Former Prime Minister: I’m walking through the remains of Coventry Cathedral, bombed and destroyed by Nazi warplanes 75 years ago, and now painstakingly and lovingly maintained as a monument to wars that we have left behind and to the sanctuary of peace. And what message would we send to the rest of the world if we, the British people, the most internationally minded of all,',541,'https://www.audiosear.ch/media/0bfcca5c79c5831162524f1cf85e3a70/0/public/audio_file/112139/20160622_WilltheUnited.mp3',72,'NewsHour','https://www.audiosear.ch/media/26153d5966e35507219bd834c97ea67a/0/thumb/image_file/60671/600x600bb.jpg'),(16,5084,'Amicus: The Politics of Law',7,'In anticipation of big decisions on marriage equality and Obamacare, many are talking about the balance of political power on the Supreme Court.

Taking that relationship one step further however, Skrillex announced that he would be starting his first radio residency on Beats 1 via his label, calling it “OWSLA Radio”. The debut of his radio show was this past Saturday, and fell in conjunction with the release of his label’s compilation “Worldwide Broadcast”. The show was a lot of fun, and had some cameos from labelmates like Mija, and artists like Getter and Ghastly, who released a song on the aforementioned compilation. Skrill was able to premiere all of the new music from his latest compilation, as well as, some tunes he’s been feeling in the past few months. For many hardcore Skrillex fans, the episode was somewhat of a let-down, however, to many, it was a great sampling into the world of Skrillex and most definitely his label, OWSLA. Hopefully, future episodes only get better and we’re excited to see what Skrillex has to offer with OWSLA Radio. Take a listen to the first episode below, including the tracklist. 1. GTA feat. Sam Bruno – Red Lips (Skrillex Remix) 2. Vindata feat. Anderson Paak – Own Life 3. Getter & Ghastly – 666! 4. ZHU & Skrillex & THEY. – Working For It 5. Wiwek feat. Audio Bullys – Rebels 6.
